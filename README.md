## Ordering PCBs
You can find the latest Gerbers attached to the [latest Release](https://github.com/LIV2/RIPPLE-IDE/releases)

I recommend ordering from JLCPCB as this board was designed within their 2-layer specifications  

BOM and Placement files for JLCPCBs assembly service are provided and can be found inside the Gerbers folder and the Gerbers.zip file found under [Releases](https://github.com/LIV2/RIPPLE-IDE/releases)

Recommended options when ordering:
* Thickness: 1.6mm
* Surface Finish: ENIG-RoHS
* Gold Fingers: Yes
* 45Â°finger chamfered: Yes

## Programming
To program the Flash, simply boot the latest [lide-update.adf](https://github.com/LIV2/lide.device/releases/latest) boot disk

The CPLD can be programmed using a Raspberry Pi [as described by LinuxJedi](https://linuxjedi.co.uk/2020/12/01/programming-xilinx-jtag-from-a-raspberry-pi/)
